In the event of automatic renewal or extension, the lease term shall extend to and the rent shall be paid through the last day of the month following the expiration of the 30-day notice period; in other words, the last month\'s rent must be paid for a full month without any proration.

Therefore, it is agreed that costs of reletting shall be a liquidated sum as stipulated, regardless of whether the actual costs are greater or lesser.  This amount shall be in addition to past due rentals, future rentals and/or charges for cleaning, repairing, repainting or other sums due under this Lease and the foregoing shall not waive or diminish Landlord\'s right to recover such additional amounts.
